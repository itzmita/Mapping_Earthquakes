# Mapping_Earthquakes
Learning JS, D3, Leaflet.js etc
## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS Mapbox API. Using this data we created various maps of earthquakes and tectonic plates around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.

## Resources 
* Data Source: Earthquakes GeoJSON, Earthquakes above 4.5mag GeoJSON, Tectonic Plate GeoJSON
* Software: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Leaflet.js, D3.js

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data

Added the tectonic Plates layer on the Earthquake layer
Here is the Street view of the data
